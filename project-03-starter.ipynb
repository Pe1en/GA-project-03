    "Your superiors have outlined this year's strategy for the company:\n",
    "1. Develop an algorithm to reliably estimate the value of residential houses based on *fixed* characteristics.\n",
    "2. Identify characteristics of houses that the company can cost-effectively change/renovate with their construction team.\n",

    "1. Perform any cleaning, feature engineering, and EDA you deem necessary.\n",

    "- Identify **fixed** features that can predict price.\n",
    "- Train a model on pre-2010 data and evaluate its performance on the 2010 houses.\n",
    "- Characterize your model. How well does it perform? What are the best estimates of price?\n",
